This is where all your content goes, you can use Markdown to help with your structure.

All your YAML Front Matter goes between the three dashes, in this page we have kept it really simple with:

* The title of the page - output in your template using the {{ title }} tag.
* The _template field - This page will use special_template to output its content if left blank it will use default.
